# CMU CS Academy Projects
In this repository, I have published the code for a few of my projects completed through CMU CS Academy in the first semester of the 2021-2022 school year. These projects wer completed as a part of the 12-unit course, with one project per unit. Note that these were all ran in an online IDE, and the code may not function as intended without using [Desktop CMU Graphics](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop) or more simply by visiting the links listed below for each project.
